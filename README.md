A set of Python UDF to extend the functionality of Apache Pig

These python UDFs can be particularly helpful for people who are migrating from Hive to Pig. Hive has a very rich set of UDF to provide additional functionality. Most of the UDF here have been inspired whilst porting Hive scripts over to Pig. 

Pig version 0.8 > supports UDFs written in Python. Pig uses Jython to dynamically compile the python to Java bytecode. This allows for the highest possible performance.

Itâ€™s worth nothing that Jython only supports Python version 2.5 so you won't find Python 3 features here.
